# Big O Notation 

A React-based interactive application that helps you learn and visualize the complexities of algorithms using **Big O Notation**. This project features a dashboard for comparing complexity, viewing animations, and testing your knowledge through quizzes. It's designed to be an engaging and intuitive way to understand time and space complexities.

## Features

- **Complexity Dashboard**: Visualize and compare different time complexities using dynamic charts and sliders.
- **Interactive Complexity Details**: Choose from a range of common time complexities (O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²)) and explore algorithms with examples and animations.
- **Algorithm Animation**: View animations of different algorithms, such as Hash Table, Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- **Quizzes**: Test your knowledge of both time and space complexities with custom quiz sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Demo

- You can interact with different algorithms and complexities, change data sizes, and view animations. Use the quizzes to test your understanding of time and space complexity concepts.
